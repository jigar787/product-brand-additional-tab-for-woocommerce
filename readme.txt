Displays WooCommerce native product brand in the Additional Information tab and adds schema.org brand markup (description, logo, link) for better SEO.

== Description ==

This plugin enhances WooCommerce product detail page by:

* Displaying the assigned product brand inside the "Additional Information" tab.
* Outputting structured data (JSON-LD) for the product's brand using schema.org markup.
* Improving brand visibility in search results by adding brand name, description, logo, and link to the product schema.

It works out of the box with WooCommerce's `product_brand` taxonomy or any compatible brand plugin using the same taxonomy.

== Compatibility ==

This plugin is compatible with:

* WooCommerce v9.4 or later

== Developer Guide ==

=== ðŸ§© Template Override Support ===

To override the brand tab layout, copy the default template into your theme:

**Destination Path:**
yourtheme/woocommerce/single-product/tabs/brand-information.php

**Original Plugin Template:**
templates/single-product/tabs/brand-information.php

You can customize how the brand name, logo, and description are displayed in the additional tab.

=== ðŸ”„ Custom Action Hooks ===

Use these hooks to inject content before or after the brand tab output:

Before the brand content block.

`do_action( 'wc_pbat_before_brand_content', $brand );`

After the brand content block.

`do_action( 'wc_pbat_after_brand_content', $brand );`


=== ðŸ”§ Helper Method ===

Render clean and filtered brand description using:

`WC_Product_Brand_Additional_Tab::get_content( $term );`

This ensures the description is properly formatted and filtered.

=== ðŸ”ƒ Filter Hooks ===

Controls whether the plugin should use `the_content` filter to format the brand description.

`add_filter( 'wc_pbat_use_the_content_filter', '__return_false' )`

**Default:** `true`


Fires only when `the_content` filter is skipped. Allows custom formatting of brand descriptions in the tab.

`add_filter( 'wc_pbat_filter_tab_content', function( $description ) {
return wpautop( esc_html( $description ) );
});`


These filters give developers full control over how brand descriptions are rendered in the tab.
